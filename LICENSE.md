License Policy

Copyright (c) 2025 Yohei Nishikubo

Default status: UNLICENSED (All rights reserved)

Except as expressly noted below, no permission is granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, or sell any part of this repository. All rights are reserved by Yohei Nishikubo and contributors. If you need additional rights, you must obtain prior written permission or a separate license agreement.

Exceptions (other forms of licensing)

- Per-file or per-directory licenses: Any file or directory that includes an explicit license notice (for example, an SPDX-License-Identifier in the file header) or a colocated LICENSE / LICENSE.md file is governed by that notice for that file or directory only.
- Package-level licenses: Where a package manifest (e.g., package.json) specifies a license, that license applies to that packageâ€™s contents unless a file within that package states otherwise.
- Third-party code: Any third-party files included in this repository remain under their own original licenses, as indicated by their headers or accompanying license files.
- Separate written agreements: If you have a written license or other agreement from the authors, the terms of that agreement control your use under its scope.

Scope and precedence

- The default UNLICENSED status applies to all parts of the repository that do not contain a more permissive license notice as described above.
- If multiple notices appear to apply, the most specific notice (e.g., a file-level SPDX license identifier) takes precedence for that file.

No patent or trademark rights are granted under this policy unless explicitly stated in an applicable license notice or written agreement.

This policy is intended to make clear that the repository is unlicensed by default, except where other licenses are explicitly provided.
